                        Spring: 2023
                        <br />
                        Sometimes a little too "buzz-wordy", this book is a great a guide to all possible events
                        that could arise as a manager. Currently 50% through, and really getting a good knowledge
                        of managerial theory, as well as practical ways to become a better leader and manager.

                        previous technological discoveries. The book kinda repeats itself really quickly however, and
                        has a few logical leaps I can't easily stomach. On the fence whether to complete or abandon, but
                        simultaneously working through The Essential Manager's Handbook.

                        Old book, so was curious how relavent it would be to now, but ended up being really really
                        useful. Especially relavent
                        with my role at CraniUS, learning formal project management techniques, relavent development
                        standards,

                        at the park in Madison, WI every weekend. At home over winter breaks. While travelling. Such a
                        beautiful book, but does take time to read and digest. Such a great description of even minor
                        human feelings; George Elliot (or who she really is) can paint amazing pictures of human
                        nature.

                        Spent a lot of time understanging every single word in this advanced graduate level book. The
                        probabilistic method is mathematical magic. The original goal was to gain such an intuition
                        into the probabilistic method that I could at a glance determine whether certain
                        problems were worth solving / feasible or otherwise. Got more than 50% of the way through, when
                        I started to lose the content, and eventually was reading to read, and not actually appreciating
                        or learning from the text. Decided to stop.

                        offer.
                        Each chapter, however, was the exact same format, and I felt like I was just reading a cookie
                        cutter
                        book. Gave up part-way though.

                        Comically rediculious, hearing the story of the 1MDB scandal, and Jho Low's parties was
                        absolutely
                        wild. Book repeated things at times awkwardly, and felt like every chapter was forcing a bad
                        mini
                        cliff-hanger, but its entertainment made up for it. Finished in less than a week.

                        really liked the idea, and want to see it expanded. The "Black Swan" counter attack is

                        This book was thick but worth it. A buddy of mine gave this to me as a gift, and after going
                        through
                        the first chapter or so, I fell in love. Dalio and I share many similar opinions about
                        efficiency
                        and ways to be productive, and I felt like it was myself writing the pages. There were some
                        parts
                        that I thought were a little preachy or I didn't competely agree with, but was a fascinating
                        read.

                        Not sure I finished reading this either. There reached a point I was only reading code, and not
                        any
                        content. However, learned a lot about ML and got to do many practice problems. Really helped,
                        and
                        inspired my interest and persuit for the summer at Bridgestone.

                        Very interesting. Kinda repetitive, but loved hearing how Gawande discovered the necessity of
                        checklists. Really inspired me to look at inefficient industries and try and find more efficient
                        solutions.

                        Might
                        be one of my favorites. I really like Frankenstein and his ardent persuit of excessive

                        Really enjoyed the beginning of this - learning about chaos was fascinating. Loved how we have
                        the

                        Enjoyed reading this. When I was younger, was a huge fan of technical analysis and playing with
                        finance charts, but enjoyed reading something that told me all that was crap and that value
                        investing is the best approach. Not sure if I finished this; I think I only got 75% through. It
                        got
                        very technical and I just became bored -- wasn't learning anything. However, the values and
                        meaning
                        of investing, and the ability to use it as a guidebook has not been lost.

                        I actually didn't like this that much. Thought it was a little repetative, and just found myself
                        wishing I were done with it. Don't know why. Have no regrets reading it, the idea of Behavioral
                        Economics is super fascinating and definately a necessity. However, just though it dry.

                        The greatest book I have ever read without a doubt. Philosophy aside, Rand created an excellent
                        novel. The way she build up the characters was amazing. I wanted to be Dagny Taggart, Henry
                        Rearden,
                        and John Galt all at the same time. It was a mystery novel while spreading an interesting
                        message.
                        Really amazing.
